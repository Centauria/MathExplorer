description: Derive immediate mathematical consequences from a theorem statement or subgoal. Use when starting a new problem, branch, or subgoal, or when cheap progress or a cleaner reformulation is needed before deeper proof search.

# Obtain Immediate Conclusions

Extract direct implications before speculative reasoning.

## Input Contract

Read from memory and current context:

- `problem_id`
- current theorem/subgoal statement
- memory

## Procedure

1. Normalize notation and restate the claim in equivalent forms.
2. List direct consequences that follow from definitions and basic algebraic/logical manipulations.
3. Split consequences into necessary conditions and candidate sufficient conditions.
4. Mark each consequence with confidence and justification type.
5. For every conclusion, explicitly decide whether it is likely fragile and should be stress-tested by counterexample.
6. If a conclusion is fragile, record why it is fragile and indicate that `$construct-counterexamples` should be considered next.

## Output Contract

Append each conclusion to `immediate_conclusions` with JSON object payload:

```json
{
  "statement": "...",
  "justification_type": "by_definition|calculation|known_fact|logical_equivalence",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "is_fragile": false,
  "fragility_reason": "",
  "suggested_followup": "none|construct-counterexamples",
  "scope": "global|branch|subgoal",
  "branch_id": "optional",
  "subgoal_id": "optional"
}
```

Rules:

- `is_fragile` must always be present.
- If `is_fragile=true`, then `fragility_reason` must explain the risk and `suggested_followup` should be `construct-counterexamples`.
- If `is_fragile=false`, use `fragility_reason=""` and `suggested_followup="none"`.

## Tools

- `uv run python -m mathx.memory append <problem_id> immediate_conclusions @record.json`
- `uv run python -m mathx.memory search <problem_id> "query" [--channels csv] [--limit 10]`
- `uv run python -m mathx.leansearch "query" [--num 10]` for nontrivial consequences
- your own `web_search` / `web_fetch` for background definitions/terminology

## Failure Logging

If no meaningful consequence is found, append an `events` entry with:

- `event_type="immediate_conclusions_stalled"`
- missing assumptions and suspected blockers
